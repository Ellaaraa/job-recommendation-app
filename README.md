# job-recommendation-app

This project is a job recommendation platform that enables users to apply up to 9 filters and assign weights to each. The algorithm identifies and returns jobs with the highest similarity scores based on the userâ€™s selections.


The dataset used in this project is sourced from here: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravindrasinghrana/job-description-dataset 

Due to the lack of quality results in the original dataset, additional location data was used https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities. Download and unzip both of these files and place them inside the current working directory.


EXECUTION:

Run the data cleaning script, which will produce 'data_sample.csv'. This will only need to be done once.
    > python clean_data.py


Generate the word embeddings, 'job_title_embeddings' and 'job_skills_embeddings.npy'. This will only need to be done once.
NOTE: this is very time consuming, use a GPU if possible. 
    > python embeddings.py 


Once the word embeddings are generated, run the app.
    > python app.py

This will run the app locally, which can be seen at http://127.0.0.1:8050
